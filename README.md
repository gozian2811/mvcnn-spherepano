# mvcnn-spherepano

This project is following Hang Su's mvcnn code at https://github.com/suhangpro/mvcnn, where the dependices and usage can all be referred. The project is developed on MATLAB 2015a, containing works of network training, retrieval testing and classification testing, while the data for training should be mannually prepared in advance.

For training, the initial input network 'net-fit.mat' is modified from mvcnn's 'imagenet-matconvnet-vgg-m.mat', with filters in one hidden layer are clipped by half, to fit the input spherical projected images of size 512*256.
